# purpose of the following commands

- `mkdir`: for making a directory
- `cd`: for creating a directory
- `ls`: to list the contents of current working directory

# why version control is important
## with version control, it is possible to:

- version control helps in keeping the code base up to date 
- getting the current version of creative file 
- helps to manage various version of brand assets
- it could benefit from just an update or its time to retire it and start fresh 
- a user can also go back from current version to previous version

# purpose of following git commands

- `git init`:it is used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a git repository or initialize a new, empty repository.
- `git status`: the git status command displays the state of working directory to the staging area. it lets the user see which changes had been staged, which aren't.
- `git add`:this helps to add a change in the working directory tp the stagging area. it talls git that the user wnats to include updates to the particular file in the next commit.
- `git commit`:the commit command is used to save the changes to the local repoistory.
- `git push`:it is used to upload local repository contentto remote repository.
- `git branch`:git branch lets the user to create, list, rename and delete branches,it dosen't let him switch between branches or put a forked history back together again. 
- `git merge`:this lets the user take independent lines of developmnet created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
- `git checkout`:the git checkout command lets the usr navigate between the branches created by git branch. checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells git to record all new commits in that branch. 

# merging of branches
- merge main branch with new branch
